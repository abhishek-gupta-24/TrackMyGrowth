## ‚ú® Key Features

* **üîê Secure User Authentication:** End-to-end user registration and login system using JWT for stateless, secure sessions.
* **üéØ Full Goal Management:** A complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for managing goals.
* **üìä Interactive Dashboard:** A central hub to view all goals and track progress at a glance.
* **üìà Progress Visualization:** Modern charts and graphs to visually represent your journey and achievements over time.
* **üì± Responsive Design:** A seamless user experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
* **‚úÖ RESTful API:** A well-structured and documented API to ensure clear communication between the client and server.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This project follows a classic client-server model. The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) that communicates with a backend RESTful API. The API handles all business logic, data persistence, and user authentication.



* **Frontend:** The user interface built with `[e.g., React]`. It makes HTTP requests to the backend API to fetch and manipulate data.
* **Backend:** The server built with `[e.g., Java & Spring Boot]`. It exposes a REST API, connects to the database, and manages all core functionalities.
* **Database:** A `[e.g., MongoDB]` database to persist all user and goal data.

---

### Backend

* **Language:** `[e.g., Java 11]`
* **Framework:** `[e.g., Spring Boot]`
* **Database:** `[e.g., MongoDB]`
* **Authentication:** `[e.g., Spring Security with JWT]`
* **Build Tool:** `[e.g., Maven]`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to get the entire application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js & npm:** For running the frontend.
* **JDK & Maven:** For running the backend.
* **Git:** For cloning the repositories.
* **MongoDB:** A running instance of the database.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Create a main project directory and clone both repositories:**
    ```sh
    mkdir TrackMyGrowth
    cd TrackMyGrowth
    git clone [https://github.com/abhishek-gupta-24/TrackMyGrowth-Backend.git](https://github.com/abhishek-gupta-24/TrackMyGrowth-Backend.git)
    git clone [https://github.com/abhishek-gupta-24/TrackMyGrowth-Frontend.git](https://github.com/abhishek-gupta-24/TrackMyGrowth-Frontend.git)
    ```

2.  **Set up and run the Backend:**
    * Navigate to the backend directory: `cd TrackMyGrowth-Backend`
    * Configure your database and JWT secret in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
    * Install dependencies and run the server (this will start on port `8080`):
        ```sh
        mvn clean install
        mvn spring-boot:run
        ```
    * **Keep this terminal window open.**

3.  **Set up and run the Frontend (in a new terminal):**
    * Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd TrackMyGrowth-Frontend`
    * Create a `.env.local` file and add the API URL:
        ```
        REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
        ```
    * Install dependencies and start the development server (this will open on port `3000`):
        ```sh
        npm install
        npm start
        ```

4.  **You're all set!**
    * üöÄ Your frontend application is now running at **`http://localhost:3000`**.
    * üì° Your backend API is running at **`http://localhost:8080`**.
